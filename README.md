## DataStructures-in-Java

**This repository houses Java implementations of various common data structures.**

## Current Data Structures

* **Stack (generic, ArrayList-based)**
* **Singly Linked List (generic)**
* **Double Linked List (generic)**
* **Stack (LinkedList Based)**
* **Queue (generic, ArrayList-based)**
* **Queue (LinkedList Based)**
* **Trie**

## Future Plans

* Implementation of additional data structures, including:
    - Trees (binary trees, binary search trees, etc.)
    - Graphs
    - Heaps
    - Hash tables
* Exploration of advanced data structures and algorithms.
